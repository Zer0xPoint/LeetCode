# Given an array arr of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order,
#  and an integer k. 
# 
#  Return the k·µó ∞ positive integer that is missing from this array. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
# Output: 9
# Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5
# ·µó ∞¬†missing positive integer is 9.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2‚Åø·µà missing 
# positive integer is 6.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= arr.length <= 1000 
#  1 <= arr[i] <= 1000 
#  1 <= k <= 1000 
#  arr[i] < arr[j] for 1 <= i < j <= arr.length 
#  
# 
#

# 
#  Could you solve this problem in less than O(n) complexity?
